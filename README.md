# Apptio-Tools
Collection of Apptio and Cloudability scripts and tools.

## Usage
These tools are primarily intended to be examples of the Cloudability and Apptio APIs, but are fully functioning! They're great for ad-hoc usage and we hope you'll use them to create your own integrations and automations.

The Python based tools in this repo typically will require a Python library that we've also published on Github: [Apptio Lib.](https://github.com/ibm/apptio-tools-lib). It's recommended to install this library if you plan to use these tools as is.

The tools are generally command-line tools and can be run from the terminal of your choice. Note that many of these tools expect a CSV or similar file in the same directory that the script resides in.

There are other resources, as well, such as Postman collections for the Cloudability API.

## Contributing
We very much welcome contributions! While we can't promise that we'll use everything you might want to share, we're quite eager to see what the Apptio / Cloudability community is cooking up. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/IBM/Apptio-Tools-Lib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detail.

## Disclaimer
These tools are provided as-is and are primarily intended to be used as examples for your own integrations. IBM Apptio does not provide direct support for this library, but do feel free to report bugs by [opening an issue](https://github.com/IBM/Apptio-Tools-Lib/issues)
